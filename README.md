<h1># Work_Day_Scheduler_DA</h1>

Calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

For this project the focus was to use Jquery, Bootstrap and other applications we have learned fo far. Initially this homework seemed simple with focusing on moment.js to get
the current, past and future time elements. I definitely struggled using jquery and had to rewrite my code several times and almost opted to use vanilla javascript instead, but I really tried to use jquery and work to get timer functions and keep the information in local storage. I learned a lot about the importance of reading the documentation and how much using jquery can help you with the DRY concept. 

Instructions:

User loads page and is presented with a event calender where user inputs event in textbox and event is recorded in local storage.
